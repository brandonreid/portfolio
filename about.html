        <p>I grew up in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nikiski,+AK+99611/@60.7206116,-151.3514065,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x56c5d875cab1e37d:0x8c8e9556499e7604!8m2!3d60.6902778!4d-151.2888889" target="_blank" title="Nikiski Alaska in Google Maps">Nikiski, AK</a>. Grand woods, frozen lakes and epic stars were my world. As technology grew with me, I used it as a portal to the outside world and a platform for a creativity. Leaving for collage was something I longed for and an experience that would open my mind immensely.</p>
        <p>Since leaving Alaska I've had the opportunity travel and live all over the country, learning from different cultures. I went to collage for design, thinking I wanted to be strictly creative but would learn that my mind is much more orientated to engineering than I thought. I've been fortunate in my career as the opportunities that came my way have helped me find a balanced craft in web design and development. Combining a certain amount of psychology and creativity with code has allowed me to work in a medium with seemingly limitless potential.</p>
