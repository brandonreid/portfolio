  <h1><span>That time I built a </span>Web App for Field Auditing</h1>
  <p>A Field Auditor is a person who visits franchise locations and checks for things like brand compliance, cleanliness, facility upkeep, etc.</p>
  <p>We built a web app for this before, but the time had come to make it good.</p>

    <h2>Setting the Stage</h2>
    <h3>Working from a previous version.</h3>
    <p>This project was a complete overhaul of a “minimum viable product” iteration (the MVP) we developed at Benchmark Intelligence, a startup I co-founded. The MVP was built on Angular 1, had basic functionality and was becoming a pain point for our customers.</p>
    <p><strong>The benefits of the MVP version were...</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>We initially built it very quickly.</li>
      <li>Our customers used it successfully for over a year.</li>
      <li>We gained lots of user feedback that we could use to do a better job on the next go around.</li>
    </ul>
