  <h1><span>That time I built a </span>Web App for Field Auditing</h1>
  <p>A Field Auditor is a person who visits franchise locations and checks for things like brand compliance, cleanliness, facility upkeep, etc.</p>
  <p>We built a web app for this before, but the time had come to make it good.</p>

        <h2>Working from a previous version.</h2>
        <p>This project was a complete overhaul of a “minimum viable product” iteration (the MVP) we developed at Benchmark Intelligence, a startup I co-founded. The MVP was built on Angular 1, had basic functionality and was becoming a pain point for our customers.</p>
        <h3>Benefits of the MVP version</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We initially built it very quickly.</li>
          <li>Our customers used it successfully for over a year.</li>
          <li>We gained lots of user feedback that we could use to do a better job on the next go around.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pain points of the MVP version</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Poor error/success messaging.</li>
          <li>Somewhat poor navigation.</li>
          <li>Refreshing would cause the user to lose survey progress. This is a pretty big challenge as connectivity in the field wasn't always reliable.</li>
          <li>Poor survey page navigation. It was very hard to know how far along in a survey you were, how many pages there were, if you completed all the pages, etc. It basically required the user to scroll to the bottom of a page to navigate forward and backwards. :\</li>
        </ol>
