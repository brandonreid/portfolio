  <h1><span>That time I built a </span>Web App for Field Auditing</h1>
  <p>A Field Auditor is a person who visits franchise locations and checks for things like brand compliance, cleanliness, facility upkeep, etc.</p>
  <p>We built a web app for this before, but the time had come to make it good.</p>

        <h2>Working from a previous version</h2>
        <p>This project was a complete overhaul of a “minimum viable product” iteration (the MVP) we developed at Benchmark Intelligence, a startup I co-founded. The MVP was built on Angular 1, had basic functionality and was becoming a pain point for our customers.</p>
        <h3>Benefits of the MVP version</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We initially built it very quickly.</li>
          <li>Our customers used it successfully for over a year.</li>
          <li>We gained lots of user feedback that we could use to do a better job on the next go around.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pain points of the MVP version</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Poor error/success messaging.</li>
          <li>Somewhat poor navigation.</li>
          <li>Refreshing would cause the user to lose survey progress. This is a pretty big challenge as connectivity in the field wasn't always reliable.</li>
          <li>Poor survey page navigation. It was very hard to know how far along in a survey you were, how many pages there were, if you completed all the pages, etc. It basically required the user to scroll to the bottom of a page to navigate forward and backwards. :\</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>My role and considerations before redesign</h2>
        <p>My role in this project was the sole designer and majority front end developer. Ken Koontz, a full stack developer and co-founder at Benchmark Intelligence, was focusing on back end engineering for other features, so I wanted to avoid the need for too much back end modification. Rocky Garcia, a full stack developer, made contributions but was mostly occupied with new features on the main Benchmark Intelligence dashboard application.</p>
        <p>Refactoring an app at a small startup is only possible with careful timing, strong will and the gracious support from teammates to grant you the time while continuing to push important features and remaining responsive to customer needs.</p>
