  <h1><span>That time I built a </span>Web App for Field Auditing</h1>
  <p>A Field Auditor is a person who visits franchise locations and checks for things like brand compliance, cleanliness, facility upkeep, etc.</p>
  <p>We built a web app for this before, but the time had come to make it good.</p>

        <h2>Working from a previous version</h2>
        <p>This project was a complete overhaul of a “minimum viable product” iteration (the MVP) we developed at Benchmark Intelligence, a startup I co-founded. The MVP was built on Angular 1, had basic functionality and was becoming a pain point for our customers.</p>
        <h3>Benefits of the MVP version</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We initially built it very quickly.</li>
          <li>Our customers used it successfully for over a year.</li>
          <li>We gained lots of user feedback that we could use to do a better job on the next go around.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pain points of the MVP version</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Poor error/success messaging.</li>
          <li>Somewhat poor navigation.</li>
          <li>Refreshing would cause the user to lose survey progress. This is a pretty big challenge as connectivity in the field wasn't always reliable.</li>
          <li>Poor survey page navigation. It was very hard to know how far along in a survey you were, how many pages there were, if you completed all the pages, etc. It basically required the user to scroll to the bottom of a page to navigate forward and backwards. :\</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>My role and considerations before redesign</h2>
        <p>My role in this project was the sole designer and majority front end developer. Ken Koontz, a full stack developer and co-founder at Benchmark Intelligence, was focusing on back end engineering for other features, so I wanted to avoid the need for too much back end modification. Rocky Garcia, a full stack developer, made contributions but was mostly occupied with new features on the main Benchmark Intelligence dashboard application.</p>
        <p>Refactoring an app at a small startup is only possible with careful timing, strong will and the gracious support from teammates to grant you the time while continuing to push important features and remaining responsive to customer needs.</p>

        <h2>The Hit List</h2>
        <p>When approaching the redesign there were a few key functionalities that I knew we needed to improve or incorporate.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Restructure Navigation</strong> – Make "saved survey progress" more accessible and add basic settings for name and password management.</li>
          <li><strong>Better Error/Success Notifications</strong> – Much better communication to the user regarding errors, processes running, connection status, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Add a Map</strong> – Location names and address can be difficult to remember, sometimes forcing the user out of the app to find a reference. A map would allow them to select the location they’re closest to or otherwise visually select it.</li>
          <li><strong>Better Survey Navigation</strong> – Users often need to jump between pages, sometimes leaving them partially complete. I wanted to design something that would make traversing pages easier and at the same time inform them of the completion status of each page as they go.</li>
          <li><strong>Automatically Save Survey Progress</strong> – In the MVP, a user's progress could be wiped out by a reload. When users are in the field, internet connection can be spotty at times, making the risks of a reload very prevalent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Designing</h2>
        <p>After some initial sketches it was off to the races in my design software. Typically I'd spend a lot more time wire-framing and user testing before drafting a polished design, but because the environment was a fast paced startup things were a little different.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <p>I did run some "gorilla" UX tests from sketches, particularly the survey page navigation UI I had come up with that was pretty unique. By "gorilla UX tests", I mostly mean roughly sketching a UI I want to validate and showing it to people around me, like my wife, co-founders, friends and random people in the halls at Bitwise. With vague questions such as "What do you think this is?" and "What do you expect to happen when you click that?", ideas can be roughly validated or ruled out with a surprisingly small sample size. Beyond that, I knew I was using established design patterns and much of the work flow already in use in the MVP version.</p>
        <p>I was also able to rely on a fairly shallow design, not going into too much detail regarding error/success messaging, etc. knowing I would be developing the front end and handling most of that messaging as it occurred in code. When I'm not developing a UI myself, a solid relationship between developer and designer is important for making sure those smaller things are accounted for and presented well. It's nearly impossible to design a UI with everything accounted for, and a major reason software designers need to understand code.</p>

        <h3>Technology Used</h3>
        <p>This application, like the MVP, would be a web app since our development team wasn't proficient with native iOS or Android development and we wanted our customers to be able to use any device, including a laptop, to take a survey. So, like the desktop dashboard we had rebuilt previously, this would be built using <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular 2</a> with <a href="https://webpack.js.org/" target="_blank">Webpack</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">Typescript</a>. I was able to spin up a development environment quickly by leveraging <a href="https://cli.angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular CLI</a>. Of course we'd also be utilizing our in-house <a href="http://usebenchmark.github.io/pattern-library/" target="_blank">pattern library</a> for general styles.</p>
